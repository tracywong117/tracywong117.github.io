Have you ever come across those captivating videos on platforms like YouTube, Twitter, or Instagram that count how many times certain word are spoken? These videos compile snippets speaking that word into one video. Now, with the power of AI, you can accomplish this task effortlessly in few minutes, without manual clipping.

OpenAI's Whisper model is a cutting-edge solution that can accurately transcribe speech into text. It achieves remarkable accuracy, potentially surpassing human capabilities in transcription. Leveraging the capability of the Whisper base model, the AI Video Segment Cutter can rapidly generates subtitles for videos and extracts specific segments based on user-defined keywords.
